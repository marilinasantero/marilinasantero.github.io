I`m still not sure how to start my blog. “What should my first blog post be about?” There’s no good answers.
Instead of writing an introductory post, I decided writing something on the subject of the moment (and the last year, and probably the next...). 
Yes! COVID, crisis, and sudden change of plans.  

The pandemic hit on us in several ways, and it had a major impact on international students. I come from Argentina, and with great enthusiasm I decided to move to Barcelona last year. I joined the doctoral program on Monday, March 2, 2020. The lockdown was declared on March 15 in Spain.

With the introduction of measures many concerns have arisen. Maintaining a good mental and physical health, caring for the beloved ones in my home-country, adapting to new ways of working remotely are just few examples of the new challenges. 

Consider my first post as an excuse to launch the blog. It will quickly get pushed down my list as I publish more. It is a promise. “Good enough” is totally fine.
