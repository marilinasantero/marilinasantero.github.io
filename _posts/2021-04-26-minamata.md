The fifth edition of the Barcelona-Sant Jordi International Film Festival [BCN Film Fest](https://www.bcnfilmfest.com/es) was held in Barcelona between April 15 and 23.
As in its previous editions, it proposes a selection of films from both the national and international scene related to the world of literature and history.

The actor Johnny Depp has presented the film 'Minamata', by Andrew Levitas, where he plays the photojournalist [William Eugene Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Eugene_Smith#:~:text=The%20book%20was%20published%20in,the%20effects%20of%20Minamata%20disease.),
a character with a life marked by addictions. Unfortunately, unfortunately the tickets were sold out so I'll meet Johnny next time, maybe. However, I went to see his movie another day and to my surprise I found that it dealt with a public health issue: "Minamata disease"
.
